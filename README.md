## Fossil and electric driven boats
75 % of the 550 commercial cannal boats were driven electric in 2020 (Reuters, 2020). So 138 boats are still driven on fossil fuel and 412 are driven electric. In 2025 all the cannal boats has to be driven electric, this is in line with transition goals of the municipality of Amsterdam. From 2025 there will be a dieselmotor ban in the city centre, to improve the climate conditions. One canal boat sails 14 hours a day, therefore there was a priority to change the motor of the canal boats.
