# Assignment 1: explanation of the files in this branch.

# Swim Route File PNG
We chose this swim route, because it is for a part based of the ALS City Swim route (from the Keizersgracht to Marineterrein). Waternet always ensures each year that the water quality on this swimming route is acceptable. Each year it has been accepted so we chose this part based off this information. Also we continued the second part of the swimming route around Marineterrein, because Marineterrein is always heavily monitored and in literature research the water quality is always acceptable for swimmers. 

# Boats File PNG
The boats png file shows that on our route there are only two public boarding locations. With this we can assume that the swimming route has a small impact on the route of canal boats. This is a geospatial dataset collected from the website of the municipality of Amsterdam. The data is geometrically represented with points.

# Comments
We recommend to use these datasets for the test event, but also take samples in April on certain points of the swimming routes and send it to "Het Waterlaboratorium" to ensure that the swimming route has an acceptable water quality.
